// There's no need to refuse this app for "completeness" since it is already an abandoned release. Its sense at App Store is only for allowing existing users to export their gacha records and local profiles.

** PLEASE DO NOT USE BETA OS RELEASES TO REVIEW THIS APP ***

Choose "Star Rail" or "Genshin Impact" and use the email and password to login HoYoLAB and tap "Done" to add account. No need to download HoYoLAB app. 

Please BEWARE the alert message from the app when you are trying to open the login page.

HoYoLAB login requires that the user must not be in Mainland China, excepting that he / she has a VPN access and the VPN server must be outside of Mainland China. Cognosphere intentionally shuts down the internet access between HoYoLAB and Mainland China due to their internal policies.

Please stop denying submissions for the lack of non-webpage built-in account registration. **This is something miHoYo does NOT allow us to do.** By handling login process through HoYoLAB webpages (or any approches miHoYo-official), we ensure that this app never touches users' passwords. Every user password input was handled via iOS secured keybard input or macOS SecureEventInputAPI, then directly sent to HoYoLAB webpage, then send to miHoYo's server. Also, it's meaningless to register new HoYoLAB / Miyoushe accounts through this app since this app only serves **veteran** players of Star Rail and Genshin Impact. The word **veteran** means that the account already has either of the game played for at least more than 10 hours with certain completion of in-game progress (archon quest / trailblazing quest).
