# The Latte Helper (powered by the United Pizza Engine)

> `The Pizza Helper` was discontinued due to inconveniencies of releasing regular updates under Lava's Apple Developer account, hence the rebranding to **The Latte Helper**.

This is the new repository for **The Latte Helper** (starting from version 5).

* It is rebranded from the previous `Pizza Helper for Genshin (v1 ~ v4)`.
* It contains all features provided in the `Pizza Helper for HSR`.
* This repository also maintains the main codebase of the United Pizza Engine.

This project uses Swift 6 and targeting iOS 17.4 and later.

### Regarding Pizza Helper / Latte Helper

* It was initially designed as a simple widget app for checking Original Resins and Trailblaze Power.
* Support for Enka Character Showcase and Gacha Record Management came later.
* Also the support for Apple Watch.
* With time, both MiHoYo and HoYoLAB enhanced their own utility features. At this point, this app is not meant to be a complete replacement for them, but rather a tool to make things easier to use.
* This app also allows users to manage their gacha records. Their data is stored both locally on their devices and in their private iCloud.

### Supported Games

* Genshin Impact (full support)
* Honkai: Star Rail (full support)
* Zenless Zone Zero (Daily Note only)

### Supported Operating Systems

Actual system requirements: Apple OS24 Series (iOS 17, macOS 14, watchOS 10)。

This project may be compilable against earlier iOS releases. However, the compiled app on these older OSes won't provide any feature except those for allowing users to export their data.

> Advanced support for ZZZ (Zenless Zone Zero) in this repository is currently not planned for the coming year due to various reasons. For now, the app only plans to support ZZZ daily notes in Widgets, Live Activity, and Today Tab.
