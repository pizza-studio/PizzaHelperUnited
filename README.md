# The Pizza Helper (powered by the United Pizza Engine)

This is the new repository for **The Pizza Helper** (starting from v5).

  - It is rebranded from the previous `Pizza Helper for Genshin (v1 ~ v4)`. 
  - It contains all features provided in the `Pizza Helper for HSR`.
  - This repository also maintains the main code of the United Pizza Engine.

This project is currently under heavy construction, using Swift 6 and targeting iOS 17.4 and later.

### Regarding Pizza Helper:

- It was initially designed as a simple Widget app for checking Original Resins and Trailblaze Power.
- Its support for Enka Character ShowCase and Gacha Record Management system comes later.
- Then both Miyoushe and HoYoLAB enhanced their utility features a little. At this point, Pizza Helper is not meant to be a total substitution of them but just to make things easier to use.
- Pizza Helper also allows users to manage their gacha records. Their data is stored both locally on their devices and on their private iCloud.

### Supported Games

- Genshin Impact (full support).
- Star Rail (full support).
- Zenless Zone Zero (Daily Note only).

> Advanced support for ZZZ (Zenless Zone Zero) in this repository is currently not planned in the incoming year due to multiple reasons. For now, this app only plans to support ZZZ daily notes in Widgets, Live Activity, and Today Tab.
