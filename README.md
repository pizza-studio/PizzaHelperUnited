This is the new repository for **The Pizza Helper** (starting from version 5).

* It is rebranded from the previous `Pizza Helper for Genshin (v1 ~ v4)`.
* It contains all features provided in the `Pizza Helper for HSR`.
* This repository also maintains the main codebase of the United Pizza Engine.

This project uses Swift 6 and targeting iOS 17.4 and later.

### Regarding Pizza Helper

* It was initially designed as a simple widget app for checking Original Resins and Trailblaze Power.
* Support for Enka Character Showcase and Gacha Record Management came later.
* Also the support for Apple Watch.
* With time, both MiHoYo and HoYoLAB enhanced their own utility features. At this point, Pizza Helper is not meant to be a complete replacement for them, but rather a tool to make things easier to use.
* Pizza Helper also allows users to manage their gacha records. Their data is stored both locally on their devices and in their private iCloud.

### Supported Games

* Genshin Impact (full support)
* Honkai: Star Rail (full support)
* Zenless Zone Zero (Daily Note only)

> Advanced support for ZZZ (Zenless Zone Zero) in this repository is currently not planned for the coming year due to various reasons. For now, the app only plans to support ZZZ daily notes in Widgets, Live Activity, and Today Tab.
