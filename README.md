# The Pizza Helper (powered by the United Pizza Engine)

This is the new repository for **The Pizza Helper** (starting from v5).

  - It is rebranded from the previous `Pizza Helper for Genshin (v1 ~ v4)`. 
  - It contains all features provided in the `Pizza Helper for HSR`.
  - This repository also maintains the main code of the United Pizza Engine.

This project is currently under heavy construction, using Swift 6 and targeting iOS 17.4 and later.

### Supported Games

- Genshin Impact (full support).
- Star Rail (full support).
- Zenless Zone Zero (Daily Note only).

> Advanced support for ZZZ (Zenless Zone Zero) in this repository is currently not planned in the incoming year due to multiple reasons. For now, this app only plans to support ZZZ daily notes in Widgets, Live Activity, and Today Tab.
