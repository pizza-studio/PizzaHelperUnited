			<h1>The Pizza Helper FAQ</h1>
<p>This document only addresses questions not covered by <em>The Pizza Helper Privacy Policy</em> and <em>The Pizza Helper End-User License Agreement and Disclaimer</em>.</p>
<h2>// Security Concerns and Usability of App Features</h2>
<h4>Q: How to use widgets? Are widgets available for watchOS?</h4>
<p>The Pizza Helper introduced watchOS widgets since v5.0.3. For information on how to use widgets on Apple devices, please consult Apple Support. Please note that widget functionalities may vary across different operating systems and their annual updates.</p>
<h4>Q: Is there an Android version of The Pizza Helper?</h4>
<p>Currently, there are no plans to develop an Android version.</p>
<h4>Q: Will using this tool result in my game account being suspended?</h4>
<p>Based on feedback received so far, there have been no reports of this happening. According to confirmation from enthusiastic players who contacted miHoYo's dedicated customer service, the response was that game accounts will not be suspended. (<em>The Pizza Helper End-User License Agreement and Disclaimer</em> mentions: <strong>The developer is not responsible for any damages caused by user actions</strong>.)</p>
<h4>Q: Is it safe for me to login my Miyoushe / HoYoLAB account via The Pizza Helper?</h4>
<p><strong>Miyoushe account logins in this app is through QRCode scan which does not need a password input</strong>; For HoYoLAB accounts, <strong>the process is protected by different methods supplied by Apple which varies by your device type</strong>: if iOS, the system-provided secure input keyboard on your screen is the one retrieving your password input; if macOS, the system-provided hardware-level SecureEventInput API directly retrieving your physical keyboard inputs. <strong>Both inputs will be directly passed through WKWebView to HoYoLAB login page</strong>. Then the server generates the device-specific Cookie which this app utilizes for servicing the user's information needs. <strong>This entire process is not interceptable by anyone else (nor The Pizza Helper app)</strong>. Thanks to Apple for making these security efforts.</p>
<h4>Q: How does The Pizza Helper handle users' gacha records?</h4>
<p>As mentioned in <em>The Pizza Helper Privacy Policy</em>, players' gacha records are stored only in these three locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Apple device you use for The Pizza Helper.</li>
<li>The iCloud private cloud space of the Apple ID currently signed in to iCloud Drive on that device.</li>
<li>Any other digital devices logged into that Apple ID with iCloud Drive enabled and The Pizza Helper installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although The Pizza Helper allows users to import and export gacha records, the development team does not recommend sharing these records to any third-party websites that may disclose statistical results without permission.</p>
<h4>Q: Which online services of The Pizza Helper might be affected by external factors beyond our control?</h4>
<p>At least the following types of services could be affected:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>HoYoLAB or miHoYo Community:</strong> Real-time notes, personal battle reports, ledgers, gacha record retrieval, character inventory lists, in-game events.</li>
<li><strong>Enka Networks:</strong> Character showcases.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each supported game, during its major version updates, often comes with temporary unavailability of the aforementioned services. Especially Enka Networks, each version maintenance typically takes one to two days.</p>
<h4>Q: Why some features are removed?</h4>
<p>Features have been removed for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Features where user experience cannot compete with Miyoushe / HoYoLAB app implementations, such as game statistics.</li>
<li>Features that can no longer be maintained due to developer time constraints, such as the Pizza Dictionary.</li>
<li>Features with unresolvable user experience issues, such as the Spiral Abyss Top Lists.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Q: After upgrading this app from the App Store, why have many features disappeared? Now only the data export function remains?</h4>
<p>Starting from v5.5.0 (v5.5.1 for watchOS app), this software has reintroduced its installability for OS21 ~ OS23 (i.e., iOS 14 ~ 16 and macOS 11 ~ 13) to replace deprecated legacy versions. This decision was made due to security concerns in older versions (v4.x and earlier) and our inability to address them through other means. Considering the unique needs of OS23 users, we have backported some core features to OS23 (iOS 16.2+, macOS 13.0+, watchOS 9.2+) and later. However, SwiftUI remains highly unstable on these OS versions, which may cause operational issues. If your usage requirements and budget permit, please switch to a device supporting at least OS24+.</p>
<h2>// App and Development Team</h2>
<h4>Q: I am a refugee of the Pizza Helper for HSR. What should I be aware of when migrating to this new app?</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Sync</strong>: Although the new unified Pizza Helper engine can read cloud data from Pizza Helper for HSR on the same Apple ID via iCloud, the data synchronization may take time and can be affected by factors like connection status. For a more reliable migration, you can export your local accounts from Pizza Helper for HSR as a JSON file (profile package) and import it into the new version of The Pizza Helper. Gacha records can also be migrated using a similar method (via file exchange conforming to UIGF v4 format).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Widgets</strong>: All widgets in the new The Pizza Helper that seem to be designed for Genshin Impact can now also display Star Rail content (excluding Genshin-specific widgets like the Realm Currency). Simply select the local profile dedicated to Star Rail in the widget settings. The Stamina Timer, implemented using iOS's built-in Live Activity feature, can also be used to show the Trailblaze Power refill status in Star Rail. User-customizable wallpaper support for widgets has been reintroduced since 5.2.1 update but cannot inherit its previous settings data. Please refer to the related UI text instructions regarding its usage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Q: How does The Pizza Helper work?</h4>
<p>The miHoYo / HoYoLAB client app requests game-related information from the miHoYo / Cognosphere server backend. This method can retrieve some game state information (such as stamina refill progress, etc.). The Pizza Helper uses your UID and Cookie information to replicate this query process and request this data from the corresponding server backend on your behalf, displaying it in The Pizza Helper's main interface and widgets. The Privacy Policy already explained how the Cookies will be used.</p>
<h4>Q: Will there be any charges in the future?</h4>
<p>miHoYo does not allow charging or embedding ads, so all features of The Pizza Helper are freely available. </p>
<p>The Pizza Helper did accept voluntary donations from users for a while, and the development team does not have any obligations to the donors. These donations will be used for app development and maintenance of associated network infrastructure. Of course, the annual fee for the Apple Developer Program membership required to distribute software via the Apple App Store will be reimbursed from this donation fund. If large donations are received, the team may publicly acknowledge the contributors. The team may also consider donating any unused funds to charitable causes at an appropriate time.</p>
<h4>Q: How do widgets automatically update a player's account status for Original Resin / Trailblaze Power / ZZZ Energy?</h4>
<p>These are collectively referred to as "player stamina" in The Pizza Helper. Since version 5.0.4, The Pizza Helper's widgets will attempt to request real-time note data from the Miyoushe / HoYoLAB servers every certain minutes necessary for the recovery of a stamina point (which differs among supported game titles). The real-time note data includes the corresponding UID's Original Resin / Trailblaze Power / ZZZ Energy status. Desktop widgets also include a refresh button for reloading content. When you open The Pizza Helper app, all widgets will automatically request real-time data again. If you haven’t consumed stamina in-game, the stamina discrepancy shown in the widgets should not exceed 1.</p>
<p>However, for iPhone models that are more than 3 years old, even if the battery has been replaced with a new one, the above widget operating mode will put a strain on battery life, so please try to minimize the number of widgets you use on such models.</p>
<h4>Q: How can I learn more about the development team or discuss other topics?</h4>
<p>You can find the development team's QQ channel and Discord channel in the "About" section of The Pizza Helper. Since April 2023, the development team has grown to three members (Lava; Bill Haku; Shiki Suen). You can click "Development Team" at the top-right corner of the "About" section to see their contact details. Due to personal career plans, only Shiki Suen is the current development maintainer since October 1, 2024.</p>
<h4>Q: Any plan on implementing advanced features regarding Zenless Zone Zero? e.g. Gacha Record Management, etc.</h4>
<p>These features won't be considered to implment in at least a year. There were too many reasons and concerns behind this decision, but one of them is that we are almost running out of our available time on this project.</p>
<h2>// Technical Issues and Know-How</h2>
<blockquote>This section discusses issues starting from The Pizza Helper version 5.2.1.</blockquote>
<h4>Q: What's the differences among the character build information (CBI) provided by Enka and HoYoLAB / Miyoushe?</h4>
<p>Thereotically, Enka Network supplies the most-accurate CBI but limited to those characters disclosed in the showcase of an UID. Meanwhile, HoYoLAB / Miyoushe supplies the CBI of all characters owned by a UID.</p>
<p>CBI supplied by HoYoLAB / Miyoushe has the following limitations due to the nature of their provided backend data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Star Rail: When a weapon (light cone) has its level at 20 &amp; 30 &amp; 40 &amp; 50 &amp; 60 &amp; 70, it is impossible to identify whether its ascension is finished. The Pizza Helper assume that all weapons at these levels are not ascended. This affect its deducted weapon build information.</li>
<li>Genshin Impact: The elemental damage boost (EDB) information  of certain characters are not calculated correctly on the HoYoLAB / Miyoushe server side, omitting the EDB gained from the character's own level ascension. In such case, please refer to his / her in-game character build information when he / she is not in the team. Characters in a team may affect each other's build information data due to members' skills and their combinations.</li>
<li>Genshin Impact: All skill levels are calculated as final results, hence inability of identifying which skill has its level boosted by the character's constellations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Q: The iOS lock screen widgets are not loading content. How can I fix this?</h4>
<p>This is likely because the widget is stuck in the data retrieval state. You can enter the lock screen widgets' edit mode, modify the widget content, and reselect the local profile (even if it's the same as the previous one). This will trigger the content update process.</p>
<h4>Q: Apple Watch is unable to sync accounts from iCloud?</h4>
<p>For iOS 18: First, turn off The Pizza Helper's iCloud sync feature, then turn it back on. Open The Pizza Helper app and leave it idle for a minute, then try syncing through the Apple Watch app. Please consult Apple Support for further instructions.</p>
<h4>Q: Can't find widgets when trying to add them?</h4>
<p>Try restarting the system and wait 10 minutes. If that doesn’t work, try turning off and on The Pizza Helper's notifications. This has a high chance of resolving the issue. If you're on macOS and the problem persists, please contact Apple Support to ensure that the app is installed in the correct location or is not duplicated in multiple locations.</p>
<h4>Q: Error codes -1 (data not retrieved) or 10102, 10103, 10104 (Cookie and UID mismatch)</h4>
<p>Check whether the real-time notes feature in Miyoushe or HoYoLAB is enabled and retrieve a new Cookie. Also, make sure the logged-in account is correct.</p>
<h4>Q: Error code 10001 (Cookie error or expired Cookie)</h4>
<p>It is recommended to log in again with the corresponding local profile. This process will retrieve a new Cookie.</p>
<h4>Q: Error code 1008 (UID error)</h4>
<p>Check if the UID corresponds to the server you selected (note: this refers to the Genshin Impact / Star Rail / Zenless Zone Zero UID, not the miHoYo / HoYoVerse Passport ID Number of your Miyoushe / HoYoLAB account). If you can't resolve the issue, please report it to us. Since version 5.0, The Pizza Helper will automatically attempt to determine the server when entering the UID in the local profile management screen.</p>
<h4>Q: How to prepare device fingerprints for UIDs governed by Miyoushe?</h4>
<p>(This question is irrelevant to those UIDs governed by HoYoLAB.)</p>
<p>This function requires traffic monitoring between the iOS version of the Miyoushe App and miHoYo server, specifically to obtain the <code>x-rpc-device_fp</code> field. Such tools will create a local virtual private network for the system to enable traffic monitoring.</p>
<p>The only current solution is for the user to use specialized traffic monitoring tools to perform packet capturing. We recommend "Stream" by Stream Lab Inc., an iOS app specifically designed for packet capture.</p>
<p>The captured contents are personal information. We suggest that the user captures &amp; users his / her own data by himself / herself.</p>
<h4>Q: How to handle the Paimon.moe gacha record format?</h4>
<p>Due to the lack of critical information fields in the Excel gacha record format provided by the website (which are all specified by UIGFv4), we have already completely abandoned support for the proprietary Excel format of Paimon.moe when implementing UIGFv4 support in (the previously) Genshin Pizza Helper. This feature is indeed not implemented in (currently) The Pizza Helper. If you need to import the data into applications that support the UIGFv4 standard, please send a feature request to Paimon.moe.</p>
<h4>Q: How to obtain gacha records URL for "Star Rail UID" and "Genshin UID hosted by HoYoLAB"?</h4>
<p>This function requires traffic monitoring between these game clients (including miHoYo's cloud games) and the miHoYo server, specifically to filter any URLs containing specific fields and domains. Such tool will create a local virtual private network to enable traffic monitoring.</p>
<p>The only current solution is for the user to personally use specialized traffic monitoring tools to perform packet capturing.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're using iOS, we recommend "Stream" by Stream Lab Inc., an iOS app specifically designed for packet capture.</li>
<li>There are too many packet capture tools for Windows and macOS systems to list here.</li>
</ul>
<p>The packet capturing rule is to filter all URLs containing the path "<code>/api/getGachaLog</code>". The domains of gacha URLs for different game regions will all start with "<code>public-operation</code>":</p>
<ul>
<li>Gacha URLs for UIDs governed by Miyoushe will have domains ending with <code>mihoyo.com</code>.</li>
<li>Gacha URLs for UIDs governed by HoYoLAB will have domains ending with <code>hoyoverse.com</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While capturing packets, the user needs to open the gacha record page (Wish / Warp history) in the game while traffic monitoring is active.</p>
<p>The validity period of the URL you capture may only be one or two hours, so please use it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The URL &amp; data you capture is of your personal privacy; please carefully consider whether to share it with others.</p>
<h4>Q: Why all of my local profiles are gone everytime I reboot my iOS device? They may come back after approximately 30 seconds, but it's still annoying.</h4>
<p>The Pizza Helper uses Group Containers to storage local profiles by default (with a mirrored copy saved in UserDefaults for Widgets). If you have encountered this issue, you can do the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to "Local Profile Manager -&gt; Menu (at the top-trailing of the UI)" to use the related menu option to export all of your local profiles as a backup file. After you finishes the Step 2, you will need to import your local profiles back using this backup file.</li>
<li>In the same menu, you go to "Advanced Options" and switch the "Local Profile Storage Location" to "App Container" instead. The app will automatically quits after you toggling this option.</li>
<li>Import the local profiles back to the app. The option is situated in the same menu mentioned in Step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a proven workaround for this issue.</p>
<h4>Q: What is the Standard Hit Rate Confidence feature in gacha statistics?</h4>
<p>The Standard Hit Rate Confidence feature in The Pizza Helper provides a reliability indicator for the standard item hit rate calculation in gacha games. This feature helps users understand how trustworthy their gacha statistics are based on the amount of available data.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence Levels and Thresholds:</strong></p>
<p>The confidence is determined by the number of relevant 5-star pulls available for analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High confidence</strong>: ≥10 cases - The calculated standard hit rate is highly reliable</li>
<li><strong>Medium confidence</strong>: 5-9 cases - The calculated standard hit rate has moderate reliability</li>
<li><strong>Low confidence</strong>: 3-4 cases - The calculated standard hit rate has limited reliability</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient data</strong>: &lt;3 cases - Not enough data to provide a meaningful calculation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to Interpret Confidence Levels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High confidence</strong> results can be trusted for making gameplay decisions</li>
<li><strong>Medium confidence</strong> results provide useful guidance but should be considered alongside other factors</li>
<li><strong>Low confidence</strong> results should be interpreted cautiously as they may not be representative</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient data</strong> indicates you need more gacha pulls before meaningful statistics can be calculated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Common Reasons for Insufficient Confidence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Too few 5-star pulls in your gacha history</li>
<li>Incomplete gacha record (missing historical data)</li>
<li>Recently started recording gacha pulls</li>
<li>Statistical result exceeds theoretical bounds (&gt;50%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Details:</strong></p>
<p>When you see a confidence indicator in the gacha statistics section, you can tap it to view a detailed explanation. This will display a message window explaining the confidence indicator-related information.</p>
<p>The confidence calculation takes into account the complexity of gacha mechanics, including pity systems and the distinction between standard and limited items, ensuring that the reliability assessment reflects the actual statistical significance of your data.</p>
<p>Note: Even when "High confidence" comes out, the final interpretation rights still belong to miHoYo, and miHoYo also has the final interpretation rights for probability calculation methods, which override this app's calculation methods.</p>

			<h1>ピザ助手 FAQ</h1>
<p>この文書は、「ピザ助手 プライバシーポリシー」および「ピザ助手アプリ使用者許諾契約及び免責声明」で言及されていない内容のみの質問に対応しています。</p>
<h2>// セキュリティに関する懸念、且つアプリの機能の信頼性</h2>
<h4>Q: ウィジェットはどうやって使いますか。watchOS でもウィジェットが利用できますか。</h4>
<p>ピザ助手（無印）は v5.0.3 版にて watchOS のウィジェットを正式に提供し始めました。Apple デバイスでのウィジェットの使い方については、Apple サポートをご確認ください。ウィジェットの機能は、オペレーティングシステムやその年次アップデートによって異なる場合があります。</p>
<h4>Q: ピザ助手のAndroid版はございますか？</h4>
<p>現在、Android版の開発予定はございません。</p>
<h4>Q: このツールを使用すると、ゲームアカウントが停止されることはございますか？</h4>
<p>これまでそのような報告はございません。miHoYoの専用カスタマーサービスに連絡した熱心なプレイヤーからの確認によれば、ゲームアカウントが停止されることはないとのことです。(<em>ピザ助手アプリ使用者許諾契約及び免責声明</em> には次のように記載されています: <strong>開発者は使用者の行為による損害について一切責任を負わぬ</strong>。）</p>
<h4>Q: ピザ助手を通じて、米遊社 / HoYoLABアカウントにログインしても安全ですか？</h4>
<p><strong>米遊社アカウントへのログインはQRコードスキャンを通じて行われ、パスワードの入力は不要です</strong>。HoYoLABアカウントの場合、<strong>iOSデバイスではシステム提供のセキュアな入力キーボードがパスワードの入力を取得し、macOSではハードウェアレベルのSecureEventInput APIが直接物理キーボードの入力を取得します</strong>。<strong>両方の入力はWKWebViewを通じてHoYoLABのログインページに直接渡されます</strong>。その後、サーバーはデバイス固有のクッキーを生成し、このアプリは使用者の「情報のニーズ」に応じてそれを利用します。<strong>この過程は他の誰にも（ピザ助手アプリにも）傍受されません</strong>。Appleのセキュリティ対策に感謝します。</p>
<h4>Q: ピザ助手は使用者のガチャ記録をどのように扱いますか？</h4>
<p><em>ピザ助手 プライバシーポリシー</em> に記載されているように、プレイヤーのガチャ記録は以下の3つの場所にのみ保存されます（柔らかい日本語で言い直します）：</p>
<ul>
<li>使用者が当アプリを使用しているApple製のデジタルデバイス。</li>
<li>使用者のApple IDに紐づけられているiCloud個人クラウド空間。</li>
<li>同じApple IDにてiCloud Driveにログインし、当アプリがインストールされている他のデジタルデバイス。</li>
</ul>
<p>ピザ助手は使用者がガチャ記録をインポート（読み込み）およびエクスポート（書き出し）できるようにしていますが、開発チームはこれらの記録を「勝手に統計結果を公開する第三者とそのウェブサイト」に共有することを推奨していません。</p>
<h4>Q: ピザ助手（無印）のネットワークサービスはどのような不可抗力に影響を受けますか。</h4>
<p>少なくとも下記のサービス提供者に関わります：</p>
<ol>
<li>HoYoLAB と米游社：リアルタイム便箋、個人作戦報告、元帳、ガチャ記録の受け取り、「持っているキャラの一覧」、ゲームイベント。</li>
<li>Enka Networks：キャラクターショーケース。</li>
</ol>
<p>このアプリがサポートしているゲームは大規模なアップデートの際に、上記の関連サービスが一時的に利用できなくなることがあります。特に Enka Networks では、アップデートに伴うメンテナンスに1～2日かかるのが一般的です。</p>
<h4>Q: 一部の機能が削除された理由を教えてください。</h4>
<p>以下の理由により、一部の機能を削除いたしました：</p>
<ul>
<li>ゲーム統計情報など、米游社 / HoYoLABアプリの実装と比べてユーザー体験が劣る機能。</li>
<li>開発者の時間的制約により、メンテナンスが困難となった機能（例：ピザ辞典）。</li>
<li>深境螺旋ランキングなど、ユーザー体験の課題が解決できない機能。</li>
</ul>
<h4>Q: App Store でこのソフトをアップグレードした後、なぜ多くの機能が消えたのですか？データのエクスポート機能しか残っていません。</h4>
<p>バージョン5.5.0以降（watchOSアプリは5.5.1以降）、当アプリはOS21～OS23（iOS 14～16およびmacOS 11～13）へのインストールを再サポートし、メンテナンスが終了した旧版を置き換えます。この決定は、旧版（v4.x以前）に存在するセキュリティ上の懸念事項への介入手段が他にないためです。OS23ユーザー層の特殊性を考慮し、OS23（iOS 16.2+/macOS 13.0+/watchOS9.2+）以降のユーザー向けに一部基本機能を移植しました。ただしSwiftUIはこれらのシステムバージョンでは未成熟であり、動作障害が発生する可能性があります。使用ニーズと経済状況が許す場合は、OS24+以上をサポートするデバイスへの切り替えをお願いします。</p>
<h2>// アプリと開発チーム</h2>
<h4>Q: 『崩スタピザ助手』の使用者です。この新しい『ピザ助手（無印）』に移行する際に注意すべきことはございますか？</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>データ同期</strong>：新しい『統一ピザ助手エンジン』で稼働している『ピザ助手（無印）』は、同じApple IDでiCloudを通じて『崩スタピザ助手』のクラウドデータを読み取ることができますが、データ同期には時間がかかる場合があり、接続状態などの要因によって影響を受けることがございます。より確実な移行を行うためには、『崩スタピザ助手』からローカルアカウントをJSONファイル（プロファイル統括パッケージ）として書き出し、『ピザ助手（無印）』に読み込むすることをお勧めします。ガチャ記録も同様の方法で移行できます（UIGF v4形式に準拠したファイル交換を通じて）。</p>

<p><strong>ウィジェット</strong>：『ピザ助手（無印）』では、『原神』専用のウィジェットも『スターレイル』のコンテンツを表示できるようになりました（洞天集宝盆などの『原神』固有のウィジェットは除く）。ウィジェット設定で『スターレイル』用のローカルプロファイルを選択してください。iOSの組み込みLive Activity機能を使って実装されたスタミナタイマーも、『スターレイル』での開拓力の補充状況を表示するために使用できます。ウィジェットのユーザーカスタム背景サポートはv5.2.1アップデートにて再びサポートし始めましたが、旧版のアプリのこの設定の引き継ぎは無理です。この機能についてのUI文字説明をご参考くださいませ。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Q: ピザ助手はどのように動作しますか？</h4>
<p>miHoYo / HoYoLABクライアントアプリは、miHoYo / Cognosphereサーバーバックエンドからゲーム関連の情報をリクエストします。この方法では、ゲームの状態情報（例えば、スタミナの補充進行状況など）を取得できます。ピザ助手は、あなたのUIDとクッキー情報を使用してこのクエリ過程を再現し、あなたの代わりに対応するサーバーバックエンドからデータをリクエストし、その情報をピザ助手のメインインターフェースやウィジェットに表示します。Cookies の取り扱いの安全配慮について、プライバシーポリシーで既に説明済みですので、その説明をご参考にしてください。</p>
<h4>Q: 将来的に料金が発生することはございますか？</h4>
<p>miHoYoは課金や広告の埋め込みを許可していないため、ピザ助手のすべての機能は無料で利用できます。</p>
<p>ピザ助手は使用者からの任意の寄付を受け入れていましたが、開発チームは寄付者に対して義務を負いません。これらの寄付はアプリの開発や関連するネットワークインフラの維持に使用されます。もちろん、Apple Developer Programメンバーシップの年間費用もこの寄付金から支払われます。大きな寄付を受けた場合、チームは寄付者を公に認めることがございます。チームはまた、適切なタイミングで未使用の寄付金を慈善団体に寄付することを検討することがございます。</p>
<h4>Q: ウィジェットはどのようにしてプレイヤーのアカウントステータス（天然樹脂、開拓力、ZZZエネルギー）を自動更新しますか？</h4>
<p>これらはピザ助手内で「プレイヤースタミナ」として総称されます。バージョン5.0.4以降、ウィジェットは「1点ごとのスタミナの回復に要る時間」ごとに米遊社 / HoYoLABサーバーから2時間ごとにリアルタイムデータをリクエストしようと試みます（対応するUIDの天然樹脂、開拓力、ZZZエネルギーステータスを含む）。デスクトップウィジェットには、コンテンツを再読み込みするためのリフレッシュボタンも含まれています。ピザ助手アプリを開くと、すべてのウィジェットは自動的にリアルタイムデータを再リクエストします。ゲーム内でスタミナを消費していない場合、ウィジェットに表示されるスタミナの差異は1を超えることはございません。</p>
<p>ところが、３年以上古い iPhone 機種には、たとえ電池が新品交換したとしても、上記のウィジェットの稼働パターンは電力の消耗の負担が掛かりますので、このような機種をお持ちしている方はできる限りウィジェットの数をお控えくださいませ。</p>
<h4>Q: 開発チームについてもっと知りたい、または他のトピックについて話し合いたいですか？</h4>
<p>開発チームのQQチャンネルやDiscordチャンネルは、ピザ助手の「設定」セクションにございます。2023年4月から、開発チームは3人のメンバー（Lava、Bill Haku、Shiki Suen）で構成されています。「設定」セクションの右上隅にある「開発チーム」をクリックすると、開発チームメンバーたちの連絡先情報を見ることができます。生涯の計画はみんなそれぞれであるため、2024年10月からメンテナンスをする開発者は Shiki Suen 一人になりました。</p>
<h2>// 技術的な問題と使い方について</h2>
<blockquote>このセクションでは、ピザ助手（無印）バージョン5.2.1以降の問題について説明します。</blockquote>
<h4>Q: HoYoLAB / 米遊社のキャラビルド情報は Enka のキャラビルド情報と比べば？</h4>
<p>Enka のキャラビルド情報は一番正しいとは言えますが、該当 UID のショーケースで公開済みのキャラクター情報には限られております。一方、HoYoLAB / 米遊社のキャラビルド情報には該当 UID の有する全てのキャラのビルド情報が含まれております。</p>
<p>HoYoLAB / 米遊社のキャラビルド情報には下記の制限はございます：</p>
<ul>
<li>スターレイルでの武器（光円錐）のレベルは 20・30・40・50・60・70 の時に、該当武器はレベル突破済みかどうかとは判断できませんので、「レベル未突破」を仮りの前提として武器の推測ビルド情報を表示するようにしました。</li>
<li>原神の一部のキャラの元素傷害増幅情報の合計結果には、キャラ自身のレベル突破による元素傷害増幅数値が含まれていないことは、一部のキャラには発生しております。従って、ゲーム内の該当キャラが「チームにはいない」状態での「ゲーム内で見えるビルド情報」をご準拠くださいませ。なお、「チーム内部のキャラたちはそれぞれの組み合わせ或いは天賦の影響のため、それぞれのビルド情報は変化している」とご注意くださいませ。</li>
<li>原神でのキャラの天賦レベルはサーバーからの合計結果であり、「命の星座からどの天賦のレベルに影響を与えたか」とは判断できません。</li>
</ul>
<h4>Q: iOSのロック画面ウィジェットがコンテンツを読み込まない。どうすれば修正できますか？</h4>
<p>これは、ウィジェットがデータ取得状態で固まっている可能性がございます。ロック画面ウィジェットの編集モードに入り、ウィジェットの内容を変更し、ローカルプロファイルを再選択してください（前のものと同じでも構いません）。これにより、コンテンツの更新過程がトリガーされます。</p>
<h4>Q: Apple WatchがiCloudからアカウントを同期できません？</h4>
<p>iOS 18の場合：まず、ピザ助手のiCloud同期機能をオフにし、再度オンにします。その後、ピザ助手アプリを開いて1分ほど放置し、Apple Watchアプリを通じて同期を試みてください。さらにサポートが必要な場合は、Apple Supportにお問い合わせください。</p>
<h4>Q: ウィジェットを追加しようとすると見つからない？</h4>
<p>システムを再起動し、10分ほど待ってください。それでも解決しない場合は、ピザ助手の通知をオフにした後、再度オンにしてみてください。これで問題が解決する可能性が高いです。macOSで問題が解決しない場合は、Apple Supportに連絡して、アプリが正しい場所にインストールされているか、重複してインストールされていないか確認してください。</p>
<h4>Q: エラーコード-1（データが取得できない）または10102、10103、10104（クッキーとUIDの不一致）</h4>
<p>米遊社またはHoYoLABでリアルタイム便箋機能が有効になっているか確認し、新しいクッキーを取得してください。また、ログインしているアカウントが正しいことを確認してください。</p>
<h4>Q: エラーコード10001（クッキーエラーまたはクッキーの期限切れ）</h4>
<p>対応するローカルプロファイルで再度ログインすることをお勧めします。この過程で新しいクッキーが取得されます。</p>
<h4>Q: エラーコード1008（UIDエラー）</h4>
<p>UIDが選択したサーバーに対応しているか確認してください（注意：これは『原神』 / 『スターレイル』 / 『ゼンレスゾンゼロ』のUIDであり、米遊社アカウント・HoYoLABアカウントのID番号ではございません）。問題が解決しない場合は、報告してください。バージョン5.0以降、ピザ助手はローカルプロファイル管理画面でUIDを入力する際にサーバーを自動的に判定しようとします。</p>
<h4>Q: UID は米遊社在籍の場合、追加情報を受け取るための特殊なデバイス指紋をどのように準備すればよいか？</h4>
<p>（この質問は、HoYoLAB在籍のUIDとは無関係です。）</p>
<p>この機能は、iOS版米遊社アプリと株式会社米哈遊のサーバー間の通信を監視し、特に<code>x-rpc-device_fp</code>フィールドのデータ値を取得する必要があります。このようなツールは、通信監視を有効にするためにシステムにローカル仮想専用ネットワーク（VPN）を作成します。</p>
<p>現在の唯一の解決策は、使用者自身が専門的な通信監視ツールを使用してパケットキャプチャを行うことです。ここでは、Stream Lab Inc.が開発したiOS専用のパケットキャプチャアプリ「Stream」を推奨します。</p>
<p>キャプチャした内容は個人情報です。使用者ががご自身のデータをキャプチャし、ご自身だけで用いることを推奨します。</p>
<h4>Q: Paimon.moeのガチャ記録フォーマットはどう処理すればよいか？</h4>
<p>当該サイトが提供するExcel形式のガチャ記録フォーマットには、UIGFv4規定に従った重要な情報欄が不足しているため、この前「原神ピザ助手」にはUIGFv4対応を実装した際に、Paimon.moeの独自Excelフォーマットのサポート機能を完全に放棄しました。この機能は現在の「ピザ助手（無印）」にも実装されていません。当該サイトのガチャ記録データをUIGFv4標準に対応するアプリに読み込む必要がある場合は、Paimon.moeには「UIGFv4で記録を書き出す機能を実装なさる」よう、ご要求くださいませ。</p>
<h4>Q: 「星穹鉄道 UID」および「HoYoLABがホストする原神UID」のガチャ記録 URL をどのように取得すればよいか？</h4>
<p>この機能は、これらのゲームクライアント（米哈遊のクラウドゲームを含む）と米哈遊サーバー間の通信を監視し、特定のフィールドやドメインを含むURLを検出する必要があります。このツールは、通信監視を有効にするためにシステムにローカル仮想専用ネットワーク（VPN）を作成します。</p>
<p>現在の唯一の解決策は、使用者が専門的な通信監視ツールを使用してパケットキャプチャを行うことです。</p>
<ul>
<li>iOSを使用している場合は、Stream Lab Inc.が開発した「Stream」というiOSアプリを推奨します。</li>
<li>WindowsおよびmacOSのパケットキャプチャツールは多すぎるため、詳細は省略します。</li>
</ul>
<p>パケットキャプチャのルールは、「<code>/api/getGachaLog</code>」パスを含むすべてのURLを検出することです。異なるゲーム地域のガチャURLのドメインはすべて「<code>public-operation</code>」で始まります：</p>
<ul>
<li>米遊社在籍のUIDのガチャURLのドメインは、<code>mihoyo.com</code>で終わります。</li>
<li>HoYoLAB在籍のUIDのガチャURLのドメインは、<code>hoyoverse.com</code>で終わります。</li>
</ul>
<p>パケットキャプチャ時には、使用者が通信監視を有効にした状態で、ゲーム内のガチャ記録ページ（祈願／跳躍記録）を開く必要があります。</p>
<p>キャプチャしたURLの有効期限は1〜2時間しかない可能性があるため、できるだけお早めにご使用くださいませ。</p>
<p>キャプチャしたURLなどのものは個人情報です。他者と共有するかどうかは慎重に検討してください。</p>
<h4>Q: なぜ、iOS デバイスを再起動するたびにローカルプロファイルが消えてしまうのですか？約 30 秒後に戻る場合もありますが、それでも煩わしいです。</h4>
<p>このアプリは、デフォルトでローカルプロファイルをグループコンテナに保存します（ウィジェットのためのUserDefaultsでの複写コピーも行っております）。この問題が発生した場合は、以下の手順を実行してください：</p>
<ol>
<li>「ローカルプロファイルマネージャー -&gt; メニュー（UI の右上）」で関連するメニューオプションを使用して、すべてのローカルプロファイルをバックアップファイルとして書き出してください。ステップ 2 を完了した後、このバックアップファイルを使用してローカルプロファイルをアプリに再び読み込む必要があります。</li>
<li>同じメニュー内の「上級設定」-&gt;「ローカルプロファイルのストレージ場所」を「アプリコンテナ」に切り替えます。このオプションを切り替えると、アプリは自動的に終了します。</li>
<li>ローカルプロファイルをアプリに再びお読み込みください。このオプションは、ステップ 1 で述べた同じメニューにあります。</li>
</ol>
<p>これは、この問題に対する実証済みの回避策です。</p>
<h4>Q: ガチャ統計の「通常アイテム命中率信憑度」機能とは何ですか？</h4>
<p>ピザヘルパーの「通常アイテム命中率信憑度」機能は、ガチャゲームにおける通常アイテム命中率計算の信頼性指標を提供します。この機能は、利用可能なデータ量に基づいて、ガチャ統計の信頼度をユーザーが理解するのに役立ちます。</p>
<p><strong>信憑度レベルと閾値：</strong></p>
<p>信憑度は、分析に利用可能な関連する5星獲得回数によって決定されます：</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>信憑度高</strong>：≥10回 - 計算された通常命中率は高度に信頼できる</li>
<li><strong>信憑度中</strong>：5-9回 - 計算された通常命中率は中程度の信頼性を持つ</li>
<li><strong>信憑度低</strong>：3-4回 - 計算された通常命中率の信頼性は限定的</li>
<li><strong>データ不足</strong>：&lt;3回 - 意味のある計算を提供するには十分なデータがない</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>信憑度レベルの解釈方法：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>信憑度高</strong>の結果は、ゲームプレイの決定に信頼して使用できる</li>
<li><strong>信憑度中</strong>の結果は有用なガイダンスを提供するが、他の要因と併せて考慮すべき</li>
<li><strong>信憑度低</strong>の結果は、代表的でない可能性があるため慎重に解釈すべき</li>
<li><strong>データ不足</strong>は、意味のある統計を計算する前により多くのガチャ回数が必要であることを示す</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>信憑度不足の一般的な理由：</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>ガチャ履歴の5星獲得回数が少なすぎる</li>
<li>不完全なガチャ記録（履歴データの欠如）</li>
<li>最近ガチャ記録を開始したばかり</li>
<li>統計結果が理論上限値（50%）を超えている</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>技術詳細：</strong></p>
<p>ガチャ統計セクションで信憑度指標を見る際、それをタップして詳細な説明を表示できます。これにより、信憑度指標に関する説明を示すメッセージウィンドウがポップアップします。</p>
<p>信憑度計算は、天井システムや通常アイテムと限定アイテムの区別を含むガチャメカニクスの複雑性を考慮に入れ、信頼性評価がデータの実際の統計的意義を反映することを保証します。</p>
<p>注意：「信憑度高」が出たとしても、最終的な解釈権は株式会社米哈遊にあり、米哈遊社は確率の計算方法についても最終的な解釈権を持ち、当アプリの計算方法よりも優先されます。</p>
