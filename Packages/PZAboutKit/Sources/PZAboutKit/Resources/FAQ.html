						class="anchor"
						aria-hidden="true"
						><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a
					>Q: How does The Pizza Helper handle users' gacha records?
				</h4>
				<p>
					As mentioned in <em>The Pizza Helper Privacy Policy</em>, players'
					gacha records are stored only in these three locations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Apple device you use for The Pizza Helper.</li>
					<li>
						The iCloud private cloud space of the Apple ID currently signed in
						to iCloud Drive on that device.
					</li>
					<li>
						Any other digital devices logged into that Apple ID with iCloud
						Drive enabled and The Pizza Helper installed.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Although The Pizza Helper allows users to import and export gacha
					records, the development team does not recommend sharing these records
					to any third-party websites that may disclose statistical results
					without permission.

						><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a
					>Q: Which online services of The Pizza Helper might be affected by
					external factors beyond our control?
				</h4>
				<p>At least the following types of services could be affected:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>HoYoLAB or miHoYo Community:</strong> Real-time notes,
						personal battle reports, ledgers, gacha record retrieval, character
						inventory lists, in-game events.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Enka Networks:</strong> Character showcases.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Each supported game, during its major version updates, often comes
					with temporary unavailability of the aforementioned services.
					Especially Enka Networks, each version maintenance typically takes one
					to two days.

				</h4>
				<p>Features have been removed for the following reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Features where user experience cannot compete with Miyoushe /
						HoYoLAB app implementations, such as game statistics.
					</li>
					<li>
						Features that can no longer be maintained due to developer time
						constraints, such as the Pizza Dictionary.
					</li>
					<li>
						Features with unresolvable user experience issues, such as the
						Spiral Abyss Top Lists.
					</li>

				</h4>
				<p>
					Starting from v5.5.0 (v5.5.1 for watchOS app), this software has
					reintroduced its installability for OS21 ~ OS23 (i.e., iOS 14 ~ 16 and
					macOS 11 ~ 13) to replace deprecated legacy versions. This decision
					was made due to security concerns in older versions (v4.x and earlier)
					and our inability to address them through other means. Considering the
					unique needs of OS23 users, we have backported some core features to
					OS23 (iOS 16.2+, macOS 13.0+, watchOS 9.2+) and later. However,
					SwiftUI remains highly unstable on these OS versions, which may cause
					operational issues. If your usage requirements and budget permit,
					please switch to a device supporting at least OS24+.

					>Q: I am a refugee of the Pizza Helper for HSR. What should I be aware

				</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Data Sync</strong>: Although the new unified Pizza Helper
							engine can read cloud data from Pizza Helper for HSR on the same
							Apple ID via iCloud, the data synchronization may take time and
							can be affected by factors like connection status. For a more
							reliable migration, you can export your local accounts from Pizza
							Helper for HSR as a JSON file (profile package) and import it into
							the new version of The Pizza Helper. Gacha records can also be
							migrated using a similar method (via file exchange conforming to
							UIGF v4 format).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Widgets</strong>: All widgets in the new The Pizza Helper
							that seem to be designed for Genshin Impact can now also display
							Star Rail content (excluding Genshin-specific widgets like the
							Realm Currency). Simply select the local profile dedicated to Star
							Rail in the widget settings. The Stamina Timer, implemented using
							iOS's built-in Live Activity feature, can also be used to show the
							Trailblaze Power refill status in Star Rail. User-customizable
							wallpaper support for widgets has been reintroduced since 5.2.1
							update but cannot inherit its previous settings data. Please refer
							to the related UI text instructions regarding its usage.

						aria-hidden="true"
						><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a
					>Q: How does The Pizza Helper work?
				</h4>
				<p>
					The miHoYo / HoYoLAB client app requests game-related information from
					the miHoYo / Cognosphere server backend. This method can retrieve some
					game state information (such as stamina refill progress, etc.). The
					Pizza Helper uses your UID and Cookie information to replicate this
					query process and request this data from the corresponding server
					backend on your behalf, displaying it in The Pizza Helper's main
					interface and widgets. The Privacy Policy already explained how the
					Cookies will be used.

					>Q: Will there be any charges in the future?
				</h4>
				<p>
					miHoYo does not allow charging or embedding ads, so all features of
					The Pizza Helper are freely available.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Pizza Helper did accept voluntary donations from users for a
					while, and the development team does not have any obligations to the
					donors. These donations will be used for app development and
					maintenance of associated network infrastructure. Of course, the
					annual fee for the Apple Developer Program membership required to
					distribute software via the Apple App Store will be reimbursed from
					this donation fund. If large donations are received, the team may
					publicly acknowledge the contributors. The team may also consider
					donating any unused funds to charitable causes at an appropriate time.

						><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a
					>Q: How do widgets automatically update a player's account status for
					Original Resin / Trailblaze Power / ZZZ Energy?
				</h4>
				<p>
					These are collectively referred to as &quot;player stamina&quot; in
					The Pizza Helper. Since version 5.0.4, The Pizza Helper's widgets will
					attempt to request real-time note data from the Miyoushe / HoYoLAB
					servers every certain minutes necessary for the recovery of a stamina
					point (which differs among supported game titles). The real-time note
					data includes the corresponding UID's Original Resin / Trailblaze
					Power / ZZZ Energy status. Desktop widgets also include a refresh
					button for reloading content. When you open The Pizza Helper app, all
					widgets will automatically request real-time data again. If you
					haven’t consumed stamina in-game, the stamina discrepancy shown in the
					widgets should not exceed 1.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, for iPhone models that are more than 3 years old, even if the
					battery has been replaced with a new one, the above widget operating
					mode will put a strain on battery life, so please try to minimize the
					number of widgets you use on such models.

						><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a
					>Q: What's the differences among the character build information (CBI)
					provided by Enka and HoYoLAB / Miyoushe?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Thereotically, Enka Network supplies the most-accurate CBI but limited
					to those characters disclosed in the showcase of an UID. Meanwhile,
					HoYoLAB / Miyoushe supplies the CBI of all characters owned by a UID.
				</p>
				<p>
					CBI supplied by HoYoLAB / Miyoushe has the following limitations due
					to the nature of their provided backend data:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Star Rail: When a weapon (light cone) has its level at 20 &amp; 30
						&amp; 40 &amp; 50 &amp; 60 &amp; 70, it is impossible to identify
						whether its ascension is finished. The Pizza Helper assume that all
						weapons at these levels are not ascended. This affect its deducted
						weapon build information.
					</li>
					<li>
						Genshin Impact: The elemental damage boost (EDB) information of
						certain characters are not calculated correctly on the HoYoLAB /
						Miyoushe server side, omitting the EDB gained from the character's
						own level ascension. In such case, please refer to his / her in-game
						character build information when he / she is not in the team.
						Characters in a team may affect each other's build information data
						due to members' skills and their combinations.
					</li>
					<li>
						Genshin Impact: All skill levels are calculated as final results,
						hence inability of identifying which skill has its level boosted by
						the character's constellations.
					</li>

					>Q: The iOS lock screen widgets are not loading content. How can I fix

				</h4>
				<p>
					This is likely because the widget is stuck in the data retrieval
					state. You can enter the lock screen widgets' edit mode, modify the
					widget content, and reselect the local profile (even if it's the same
					as the previous one). This will trigger the content update process.

				</h4>
				<p>
					For iOS 18: First, turn off The Pizza Helper's iCloud sync feature,
					then turn it back on. Open The Pizza Helper app and leave it idle for
					a minute, then try syncing through the Apple Watch app. Please consult

				<p>
					Try restarting the system and wait 10 minutes. If that doesn’t work,
					try turning off and on The Pizza Helper's notifications. This has a

				</p>
				<p>
					The only current solution is for the user to use specialized traffic

					&quot;Stream&quot; by Stream Lab Inc., an iOS app specifically
					designed for packet capture.

					>Q: How to handle the Paimon.moe gacha record format?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Due to the lack of critical information fields in the Excel gacha

					UIGFv4), we have already completely abandoned support for the
					proprietary Excel format of Paimon.moe when implementing UIGFv4
					support in (the previously) Genshin Pizza Helper. This feature is

					>Q: How to obtain gacha records URL for &quot;Star Rail UID&quot; and
					&quot;Genshin UID hosted by HoYoLAB&quot;?
				</h4>
				<p>
					This function requires traffic monitoring between these game clients
					(including miHoYo's cloud games) and the miHoYo server, specifically
					to filter any URLs containing specific fields and domains. Such tool
					will create a local virtual private network to enable traffic
					monitoring.
				</p>
				<p>
					The only current solution is for the user to personally use
					specialized traffic monitoring tools to perform packet capturing.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you're using iOS, we recommend &quot;Stream&quot; by Stream Lab
						Inc., an iOS app specifically designed for packet capture.
					</li>
					<li>
						There are too many packet capture tools for Windows and macOS
						systems to list here.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The packet capturing rule is to filter all URLs containing the path
					&quot;<code>/api/getGachaLog</code>&quot;. The domains of gacha URLs
					for different game regions will all start with
					&quot;<code>public-operation</code>&quot;:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Gacha URLs for UIDs governed by Miyoushe will have domains ending
						with <code>mihoyo.com</code>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Gacha URLs for UIDs governed by HoYoLAB will have domains ending
						with <code>hoyoverse.com</code>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					While capturing packets, the user needs to open the gacha record page
					(Wish / Warp history) in the game while traffic monitoring is active.
				</p>
				<p>
					The validity period of the URL you capture may only be one or two
					hours, so please use it as soon as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					The URL &amp; data you capture is of your personal privacy; please
					carefully consider whether to share it with others.

					>Q: Why all of my local profiles are gone everytime I reboot my iOS

					still annoying.
				</h4>
				<p>
					The Pizza Helper uses Group Containers to storage local profiles by
					default (with a mirrored copy saved in UserDefaults for Widgets). If
					you have encountered this issue, you can do the following steps:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Go to &quot;Local Profile Manager -&gt; Menu (at the top-trailing of
						the UI)&quot; to use the related menu option to export all of your
						local profiles as a backup file. After you finishes the Step 2, you
						will need to import your local profiles back using this backup file.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the same menu, you go to &quot;Advanced Options&quot; and switch
						the &quot;Local Profile Storage Location&quot; to &quot;App
						Container&quot; instead. The app will automatically quits after you
						toggling this option.
					</li>
					<li>
						Import the local profiles back to the app. The option is situated in
						the same menu mentioned in Step 1.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>This is a proven workaround for this issue.</p>

					>問：為什麼我在商店升級這個軟體後，很多功能反而消失了？甚至只剩匯出資料的功能？
				</h4>
				<p>
					自 5.5.0 版本起（watchOS App 則自 5.5.1 版本起），本軟體恢復了對 OS21
					~ OS23（即 iOS 14 ~ 16 與 macOS 11 ~
					13）的安裝支援，以取代已被棄用的舊版。此決策源於舊版（v4.x
					及更早版本）存在資安疑慮，且我們無法透過其他手段介入處理。考量到 OS23
					使用者群體的特殊性，我們仍為 OS23（iOS 16.2+/macOS 13.0+/watchOS
					9.2+）以上使用者移植了部分基礎功能。但 SwiftUI
					在這些系統版本中仍極不成熟，難免存在使用故障。若您的使用需求與經濟能力允許，請更換至少支援
					OS24+ 的設備。

					>Q: 我是星鐵披薩小助手的使用者，請問在遷移過來時需要注意什麼？
				</h4>
				<p>
					一是資料同步：雖然基於統一披薩引擎的全新的披薩小助手可以藉由 iCloud
					讀取到同一 Apple ID
					下的星鐵披薩小助手的雲端資料，但同步讀取資料是需要時間的、且可能受到包括連線狀態等多方因素之影響。如希望能有更穩妥的遷移手段的話，您可以藉由星鐵披薩小助手將其本機帳號全部匯出為一個
					JSON、再匯入到目前的新版披薩小助手內。抽卡記錄也可以用類似的手段遷移（使用
					UIGF v4 格式）。
				</p>
				<p>
					二是小工具（小組件）：全新的披薩小助手的所有看似給原神設計的小工具都是可以顯示星穹鐵道的內容的（洞天寶錢等原神專屬小工具除外），直接在小工具設定裡面選擇您創建的星穹鐵道專用的本機帳號即可。依賴
					iOS 內建的即時動態（Live
					Activity）功能實作的玩家體力計時器也可以用來顯示星穹鐵道的開拓力回滿狀態。對於小工具的自訂壁紙的功能支持則是從
					5.2.1
					版更新開始支援，且無法繼承之前的設定。詳情請洽相關功能的介面文字說明。

					>Q: 小工具（小組件）是怎樣自動更新玩家的帳號的原粹樹脂 / 開拓力 /
					絕區電量狀態的？
				</h4>
				<p>
					這些在披薩小助手被統稱為「玩家體力（Stamina）」。從 5.0.4
					版開始，披薩小助手的小工具每過一個玩家體力點恢復時間就會嘗試向米遊社 /
					HoYoLAB 伺服器請求一次最新的實時便箋資料（裡面包括了對應 UID
					的原粹樹脂 / 開拓力 /
					絕區電量狀態等資訊）。桌面小工具額外會有用於重載內容專用的刷新按鈕。開啟披薩小助手本體
					App
					時，所有小工具都會自動重新請求一次實時便箋資料。如果您未曾登入遊戲消耗過玩家體力的話，理論上藉由小工具顯示的玩家體力的誤差不會超過
					1。
				</p>
				<p>
					然而，對於3年以上的舊款iPhone機種來講，哪怕有更換過新的電池，上述的小工具運作規律也會增加電力的消耗。因此，請在使用這類機種時盡量控制小工具的數量。

					Enka 面板的結果理論上是最準確的結果，但只能顯示某個 UID
					的公開展櫃內的角色；而 HoYoLAB /
					米遊社面板則允許您以近乎相同的面板閱讀體驗來檢視自己全部的在庫角色。
				</p>
				<p>
					由於後者可提供的後端資料有限，所以 HoYoLAB /
					米遊社面板內容有下述限制：
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						星穹鐵道的武器在 20 &amp; 30 &amp; 40 &amp; 50 &amp; 60 &amp; 70
						級時沒有任何辦法判斷是否有經過等級突破，只能以「尚未完成等級突破」為前提來推斷此時的武器面板資料。
					</li>
					<li>
						原神的部分角色可能會有「忘記統計某些角色自身突破所帶來的特定元素的傷害增幅」的情況，屆時請以「在遊戲內將該角色移出隊伍之後、遊戲內顯示的該角色的面板」為基準、來決定是否向
						HoYoLAB / 米遊社提報相關故障。
						<ul>
							<li>
								注意：不將該角色移出隊伍的話，隊伍內不同的角色組合、乃至個別角色的天賦都有可能影響到遊戲內顯示的隊員們的面板數值。
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						原神的查詢結果無法將角色技能基礎等級與命座天賦等級加成分開統計，因為拿到的原始數值就是經過合算的最終技能等級。
					</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Windows 與 macOS 系統的抓包工具太多，不作贅述。</li>
				</ul>
				<p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						前往「本機帳號管理器 -&gt;
						選單（位於介面右上角）」並使用相關選單選項將所有本機帳號匯出為備份檔案。在完成步驟

					</li>
					<li>
						在相同的選單中，進入「進階選項」並將「本機帳號存儲位置」切換為「應用程式容器」。切換此選項後，披薩小助手會自動退出。
					</li>
					<li>將本機帳號匯入到披薩小助手內。此選項位於步驟 1 所述的選單中。</li>

					>Q: 我是星铁披萨小助手的用户，请问在迁移过来时需要注意什么？
				</h4>
				<p>
					一是资料同步：虽然基于统一披萨引擎的全新的披萨小助手可以通过 iCloud
					读取到同一 Apple ID
					下的星铁披萨小助手的云端资料，但同步读取资料是需要时间的、且可能受到包括网络连接状态等多方因素之影响。如希望能有更稳妥的迁移手段的话，您可以通过星铁披萨小助手将其本地账号全部导出为一个
					JSON、再导入到目前的新版披萨小助手内。抽卡记录也可以用类似的手段迁移（使用
					UIGF v4 格式）。
				</p>
				<p>
					二是小工具（小组件）：全新的披萨小助手的所有看似给原神设计的小工具都是可以显示星穹铁道的内容的（洞天宝钱等原神专属小工具除外），直接在小工具设定里面选择您创建的星穹铁道专用的本地账号即可。依赖
					iOS 内建的实时活动（Live
					Activity）功能实作的玩家体力计时器也可以用来显示星穹铁道的开拓力回满状态。对于小工具的自订壁纸的功能支持则是从
					5.2.1
					版更新开始支持，且无法继承之前的设定。详情请洽相关功能的介面文字说明。
				</p>

					>Q: 披萨小助手的工作原理是什么？
				</h4>
				<p>
					米游社 / HoYoLAB 客户端应用（client app）会通过向米哈游 / Cognosphere
					的服务器的后端请求游戏内的一些资讯。这个手段可以查询到一些与此有关的游戏状态资讯（比如玩家体力的回满进度，等）。披萨小助手使用您的
					UID 与 Cookie 资讯可以重复这个查询过程、代替您使用这两款 App
					向对应的服务器的后端请求游戏内的这些资讯、并展示于披萨小助手的主界面与小工具当中。《披萨小助手隐私政策》已经解释了与这些
					Cookies 的使用有关的内容。

					>Q: 未来会收费吗？
				</h4>
				<p>
					米哈游不允许收费或植入收费广告，所以披萨小助手的所有功能都是免费提供开放使用的。
				</p>
				<p>
					披萨小助手曾经接受过来自用户的自发捐赠（目前不再接受捐赠），且敝团队不会因此对捐赠者产生任何义务。这类捐赠内容会用于
					App 开发、及其连带网络设施的维护。当然，通过 Apple App Store
					发行软件所必须的 Apple Developer Program
					会员身分的年费也会从这笔捐赠金报销。如有收到大宗捐赠的话，敝团队可能会公示他们的贡献。敝团队也可能会考虑在适当的时间点将用不完的经费捐赠给社会公益之用途。

					>Q: 小工具（小组件）是怎样自动更新玩家的账号的原粹树脂 / 开拓力 /
					绝区电量状态的？
				</h4>
				<p>
					这些在披萨小助手被统称为「玩家体力（Stamina）」。从 5.0.4
					版开始，披萨小助手的小工具每过一个玩家体力点恢复时间就会尝试向米游社 /
					HoYoLAB 服务器请求一次最新的实时便笺资料（里面包括了对应 UID
					的原粹树脂 / 开拓力 /
					绝区电量状态等资讯）。桌面小工具额外会有用于重载内容专用的刷新按钮。开启披萨小助手本体
					App
					时，所有小工具都会自动重新请求一次实时便笺资料。如果您未曾登入游戏消耗过玩家体力的话，理论上通过小工具显示的玩家体力的误差不会超过
					1。
				</p>
				<p>
					然而，对于3年以上的旧款iPhone机种来讲，哪怕有更换过新的电池，上述的小工具运作规律也会增加电力的消耗。因此，请在使用这类机种时尽量控制小工具的数量。

					>Q: HoYoLAB / 米游社面板相对于 Enka 面板而言有何差异？
				</h4>
				<p>
					Enka 面板的结果理论上是最准确的结果，但只能显示某个 UID
					的公开展柜内的角色；而 HoYoLAB /
					米游社面板则允许您以近乎相同的面板阅读体验来检视自己全部的在库角色。
				</p>
				<p>
					由于后者可提供的后端资料有限，所以 HoYoLAB /
					米游社面板内容有下述限制：
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						星穹铁道的武器在 20 &amp; 30 &amp; 40 &amp; 50 &amp; 60 &amp; 70
						级时没有任何办法判断是否有经过等级突破，只能以「尚未完成等级突破」为前提来推断此时的武器面板数据。
					</li>
					<li>
						原神的部分角色可能会有「忘记统计某些角色自身突破所带来的特定元素的伤害增幅」的情况，届时请以「在游戏内将该角色移出队伍之后、游戏内显示的该角色的面板」为基准、来决定是否向
						HoYoLAB / 米游社提报相关故障。
						<ul>
							<li>
								注意：不将该角色移出队伍的话，队伍内不同的角色组合、乃至个别角色的天赋都有可能影响到游戏内显示的队员们的面板数值。
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						原神的查询结果无法将角色技能基础等级与命座天赋等级加成分开统计，因为拿到的原始数值就是经过合算的最终技能等级。
					</li>
				</ul>

				</h4>
				<p>
					<em>ピザ助手 プライバシーポリシー</em>
					に記載されているように、プレイヤーのガチャ記録は以下の3つの場所にのみ保存されます（柔らかい日本語で言い直します）：
				</p>

					<li>
						同じApple IDにてiCloud
						Driveにログインし、当アプリがインストールされている他のデジタルデバイス。
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					ピザ助手は使用者がガチャ記録をインポート（読み込み）およびエクスポート（書き出し）できるようにしていますが、開発チームはこれらの記録を「勝手に統計結果を公開する第三者とそのウェブサイト」に共有することを推奨していません。

				<p>
					バージョン5.5.0以降（watchOSアプリは5.5.1以降）、当アプリはOS21～OS23（iOS
					14～16およびmacOS
					11～13）へのインストールを再サポートし、メンテナンスが終了した旧版を置き換えます。この決定は、旧版（v4.x以前）に存在するセキュリティ上の懸念事項への介入手段が他にないためです。OS23ユーザー層の特殊性を考慮し、OS23（iOS
					16.2+/macOS
					13.0+/watchOS9.2+）以降のユーザー向けに一部基本機能を移植しました。ただしSwiftUIはこれらのシステムバージョンでは未成熟であり、動作障害が発生する可能性があります。使用ニーズと経済状況が許す場合は、OS24+以上をサポートするデバイスへの切り替えをお願いします。

					>Q:
					ウィジェットはどのようにしてプレイヤーのアカウントステータス（天然樹脂、開拓力、ZZZエネルギー）を自動更新しますか？
				</h4>
				<p>
					これらはピザ助手内で「プレイヤースタミナ」として総称されます。バージョン5.0.4以降、ウィジェットは「1点ごとのスタミナの回復に要る時間」ごとに米遊社
					/
					HoYoLABサーバーから2時間ごとにリアルタイムデータをリクエストしようと試みます（対応するUIDの天然樹脂、開拓力、ZZZエネルギーステータスを含む）。デスクトップウィジェットには、コンテンツを再読み込みするためのリフレッシュボタンも含まれています。ピザ助手アプリを開くと、すべてのウィジェットは自動的にリアルタイムデータを再リクエストします。ゲーム内でスタミナを消費していない場合、ウィジェットに表示されるスタミナの差異は1を超えることはございません。
				</p>
				<p>
					ところが、３年以上古い iPhone
					機種には、たとえ電池が新品交換したとしても、上記のウィジェットの稼働パターンは電力の消耗の負担が掛かりますので、このような機種をお持ちしている方はできる限りウィジェットの数をお控えくださいませ。

				</h4>
				<p>（この質問は、HoYoLAB在籍のUIDとは無関係です。）</p>
				<p>
					この機能は、iOS版米遊社アプリと株式会社米哈遊のサーバー間の通信を監視し、特に<code>x-rpc-device_fp</code>フィールドのデータ値を取得する必要があります。このようなツールは、通信監視を有効にするためにシステムにローカル仮想専用ネットワーク（VPN）を作成します。
				</p>
				<p>
					現在の唯一の解決策は、使用者自身が専門的な通信監視ツールを使用してパケットキャプチャを行うことです。ここでは、Stream

				<p>
					この機能は、これらのゲームクライアント（米哈遊のクラウドゲームを含む）と米哈遊サーバー間の通信を監視し、特定のフィールドやドメインを含むURLを検出する必要があります。このツールは、通信監視を有効にするためにシステムにローカル仮想専用ネットワーク（VPN）を作成します。

						Inc.が開発した「Stream」というiOSアプリを推奨します。
					</li>
					<li>
						WindowsおよびmacOSのパケットキャプチャツールは多すぎるため、詳細は省略します。
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					パケットキャプチャのルールは、「<code>/api/getGachaLog</code>」パスを含むすべてのURLを検出することです。異なるゲーム地域のガチャURLのドメインはすべて「<code>public-operation</code>」で始まります：
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						米遊社在籍のUIDのガチャURLのドメインは、<code>mihoyo.com</code>で終わります。
					</li>
					<li>
						HoYoLAB在籍のUIDのガチャURLのドメインは、<code>hoyoverse.com</code>で終わります。

				</ul>
				<p>
					パケットキャプチャ時には、使用者が通信監視を有効にした状態で、ゲーム内のガチャ記録ページ（祈願／跳躍記録）を開く必要があります。
				</p>
				<p>
					キャプチャしたURLの有効期限は1〜2時間しかない可能性があるため、できるだけお早めにご使用くださいませ。
