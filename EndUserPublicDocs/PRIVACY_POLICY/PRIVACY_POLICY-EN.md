> All translations of this document are for reference purposes only. The original Simplified Chinese version of this document is the only legally binding version.

Pizza Studio has released the "The Pizza Helper" application (2022 version, 2024 re-release) as an open-source app. This service is provided by Pizza Studio (hereinafter referred to as "the Developer") for free via the Mac App Store and iOS App Store.

If someone decides to use the "The Pizza Helper" (hereinafter referred to as "this application"), this page is used to inform visitors about the collection, use, and disclosure of data by the application.

If you choose to use the Developer's services, you can decide whether this application collects and uses information related to this privacy policy. The information collected by the Developer is used to provide and improve the service. Except as described in this privacy policy, the Developer will not use or share your information with anyone.

The terms used in this privacy policy have the same meaning as those in the Developer's Terms and Conditions, which can be obtained from within this application unless otherwise defined in this privacy policy.

### **Collection and Use of Information**

This application requires submitting the UID number to query the in-game character showcase information through Enka Networks' public query service. The UID number itself can only be used to locate the corresponding player within the Mihoyo game and cannot be used by anyone outside of Mihoyo, Inc. to reverse-engineer the player's true identity. However, the UID may reveal the country or region of the game server the player is located on. It is important to note that, as Enka Networks is a public query service, the character nickname and signature obtained through the given UID might expose the player's personal privacy, depending on the information they have included in their nickname and signature. Since this information is voluntarily made public by the player in the game, the Developer of this application do not bear any responsibility in this regard.

For cases other than the above exception: Should the User agree, the Developer shall collect information related to the Spiral Abyss. This includes the following:

- If the User has achieved full stars in the current season of the Spiral Abyss:

    - Characters used in the User's Spiral Abyss challenges from floors 9 to 12.
    - The User's Spiral Abyss combat leaderboard.
    - All of the User's owned characters and their character build details.
    - The User's game UID number. **Note**: This number is used to ensure the User's data is not resubmitted and to permanently filter out any data from potential cheaters.
    - The reserved username of the user's Snap Hutao account.

The collected information does not include any personally identifiable information, device details, or account information, thereby ensuring the protection of the User's privacy.

All other information is stored in the following three locations:

- The Apple digital device you use with this application.
- The iCloud private space associated with the Apple ID that is logged into iCloud Drive on that digital device.
- Any digital device logged into the same Apple ID using iCloud Drive and has the application installed.

This application does not transmit User data to the Developer's servers, except for the cases listed above. The collected information is used solely for service interaction and personalization. The Developer does not collect any other types of User information.

### **Log Data**

This application does not collect user crash log data; it is instead collected by Apple with the user's permission. The crash log data collected by Apple is filtered by Apple to remove any content that could be used to identify the user personally, and is presented to the Developer through Apple Store Connect. The Developer can read the crash reports collected by Apple via Xcode's Organizer. Users can also provide crash reports through macOS's built-in Feedback Assistant application, and this process also submits the error report to the Developer via Apple Store Connect.

### **Cookies**

Although certain features of this application rely on cookies, these cookies are only likely to appear in the following three locations:

- The Apple digital device you use with this application.
- The iCloud private cloud space associated with the Apple ID that is logged into iCloud Drive on that digital device.
- Any digital device logged into the same Apple ID using iCloud Drive and has the application installed.

The Developer does not collect any cookies data from users.

For the following reasons, the Developer may collaborate with third-party companies (Apple Inc.):

* To provide the application on the Mac App Store and iOS App Store.
